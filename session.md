The idea of correlating logs, traces, and metrics is not very unfamiliar for some people. Grafana recently announced on their blog briefly about how they handle their incidents by using the observabilities of logs, traces, and metrics. However, that is not what we aim for. Our goal solely is the ability to guess accurately what is wrong with the system when a problem emerges. Therefore, an overview of both logs, traces, and metrics in one place becomes necessary in this situation. Though we mention it is possible to retrieve all logs of a route in Kibana UI, we do not do it often due to the fact that logs in span details come in handy when we need to see them. It does not mean replacing Kibana UI, Grafana or anything but switching between tabs can be avoidable.
