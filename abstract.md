We present an effective way to create a strong correlation between logs, traces, and metrics in a distributed system consisting of cloud-native apps. In our applications, we use Jaeger to trace internal as well as external operations and tracing data are stored in an ElasticSearch cluster. However,  we put trace context which includes traceId and spanId in logs by using mapped diagnostic context (MDC). Hence, logs kept in the same ElasticSearch cluster will have trace context itself. By that means, we will be capable of querying all logs of a route throughout the system in Kibana UI with its traceId only. Furthermore, metrics such as memory, CPU usage, etc. are collected through a Spring Boot Actuator endpoint and put in span tags whenever a span is built. With that information, it provides us with an overview of the container and the running process directly by observing span details.
