We present an effective way to create a strong correlation between logs, traces, and metrics in a cloud native ecosystem. Our system is consisted of applications applying microservice architecture and running on an infrastructure powered by OpenStack. Besides collecting logs, traces, and metrics independently, we aggregate all of them within Jaeger spans. We keep trace id inside logs and store them in the same ElasticSearch cluster which helps us query all logs of a route throughout the system in Kibana UI effortlessly. Furthermore, metrics such as memory, CPU usage, etc. are collected through endpoints and put in span tags whenever a span is built; it provides us with an overview of the container and the running process directly by observing span details.
